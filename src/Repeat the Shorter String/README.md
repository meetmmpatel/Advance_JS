# Repeat the Shorter String

`Loops` `Strings`

Write a function that repeats the shorter string until it is equal to the length of the longer string.

### Examples

```js
lengthen("abcdefg", "ab") ➞ "abababa"

lengthen("ingenius", "forest") ➞ "forestfo"

lengthen("clap", "skipping") ➞ "clapclap"
```

### Notes

- Both strings will differ in length.
- Both strings will contain at least one character.
